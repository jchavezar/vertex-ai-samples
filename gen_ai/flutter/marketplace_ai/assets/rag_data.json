        "Product Title: Kofod Larsen for Selig Mid Century Walnut Sofa - mcm Product Description: Kofod Larsen for Selig Mid Century Walnut Sofa\\n\\nThis sofa measures: 75 wide x 30 deep x 30 inches high, with a seat height of 18 and arm height of 21 inches\\n\\nThis price includes getting this piece/set in what we call Restored Vintage Condition. That means the piece is permanently fixed upon purchase so it\u2019s free of watermarks, chips or deep scratches with color loss, as well as thoroughly cleaned and any moving parts (if applicable, such as doors, drawers, etc) are tested for smooth function - all of this is done at no additional cost to you, but it will take longer to ship than if you choose not to take this option.\\n\\nIf this is not quite what you&#39;re looking for, we have a lot more Mid-century / Mid century Modern / Danish Design / Scandinavian / retro / vintage mcm furniture listed for sale on our website, as well as a large collection of mid-century modern designer furniture in our catalog where you can sign up to be the first to know when we get a particular piece you love back in stock.\\n\\nAnd since only about HALF of our 2100+ pieces are online, we invite you to see our warehouse in person in the Chicago area. Please call, text, or use the Book Appointment link on our site to schedule a private, one-on-one warehouse showing.  You may also schedule a Zoom or Facetime warehouse visit from our home page.\\n\\nFREE SHIPPING: Most of our pieces on Etsy ship for FREE within 8-10 weeks, depending on our restoration lead time. After restoration work is done, our team of trusted shippers carefully blanket and shrink wrap each individual piece for maximum protection during transit. Your order will then be delivered to your door or just inside your home. Please keep in mind this is a single man making the delivery and he appreciates having some help to unload.\\n\\nFREE RESTORATION:  The price includes getting this piece in what we call Restored Vintage Condition.  When you purchase a piece we carefully clean and prepare it for shipping. If during re-inspection we discover a door or drawer isn\u2019t functioning properly, find water marks and visible scratches with color loss (usually on the top surface) or veneer chips, our Master Restoration Team carefully restores the surfaces using tried and true restoration techniques with the original colors and finishes used by the manufacturer (the same way it was made) so you get an original MCM piece without the disappointment of bad refinishing or undisclosed hidden problems.  \\n\\nSAVE ON AS IS:  Some pieces can be purchased at a discount if you do your own restoration.  This saves the time to ship by usually 1-2 weeks, too. Contact us for full condition report.\\n\\nSAVE ON REFINISHING and RE-UPHOLSTERY:  We also fully re-upholster, refinish, or even customize the piece for a fee and at discounted rates before it ships.  \\n\\nFREE FINDER SERVICE:  We have over 2100 pieces in our current inventory and we get new pieces in daily; so if you tell us what you\u2019re considering buying and the price that works for you we\u2019ll find it, fix it, and get it in your order with free shipping.   \\n\\nABOUT PHOTOS:  We take our photos in a controlled lighting studio to show as much detail as possible. We do NOT Photoshop out blemishes. In almost all cases, the photos were taken before any work is done improving the piece, therefore the piece you get is often even better looking than it was in the photos. In some situations when we get the exact same piece back in stock that we&#39;ve had before, we will use photos from a previous shoot. In these situations, the piece you get will be in the same (or better) condition than the photos.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is we know how hard it is to purchase all the mid century furniture you need from multiple sources in different parts of the country and get them restored to your liking and shipped to your door at the same time, so we try to make all this as painless and worry-free as possible.\\n\\nWe keep you fully informed throughout the whole process - because we want you to be happy with your purchase and tell everyone how easy it is to buy real mid century modern furniture online without throwing their money away.  \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAll of us at Modern Hill Furniture Warehouse\\n\\nInstagram - Modern_Hill_\\nFacebook - ModernHillWarehouse\\n\\nFollow us for the fastest way to view our weekly new treasures!

VAN OSDOL :\\n\\nSee more art here: https://fineartamerica.com/artists/scottdvanosdolfinearts\\n\\nScott D. Van Osdol took private art studies for a few years, starting at the very young age of 8, from a Brown County, Indiana artist and won the Eulula Gray scholarship in Arts (the largest scholarship available in Arts) for Vincennes University at the age of 17. He has a great passion for animals and wild connection and love of the great outdoors! His vibrant, colorful art can be found all over the world and especially in many small coastal shops, beachside rentals and high-end coastal homes up and down the eastern coastline of the beautiful shores of the United States. \\n\\nAs a child he was influenced heavily by his family&#39;s outdoor camping and fishing trips as well as vacations to the Florida coastline.

Expect knots, cracks, dents, dings, marks, discolorations. In most cases we make sure the piece has some of all of the above. All of our pieces are handmade one at a time. We love doing what we do and it shows! \\n\\nVariations in size, color and texture are common occurrences in reclaimed wood and should not be considered as defects. Such features as old saw marks, nail or worm holes, uneven boards, sunspots etc. are what make these tables unique and special. While every precaution has been taken in our finishing process to prevent movement in the wood, fine splits, warping, wobbles may occur as the wood adjusts to new conditions of your home. Please realize that your computer monitor settings may show colors different than ours, some photos are taken on bright sunny days, others on cloudy days, some under inside artificial lighting, some on snow covered days outside. People see colors differently. What may look like aqua blue to myself may look like teal blue to you. We allow our customers to send us a paint brand name/color name and/or color code to use on your order at no extra charge and because of this we do NOT refund on any color issues as we will purchase and use the exact paint or stain color you tell us to use. All color changes must be in the payment note area during checkout, not in back and forth message threads, emails, phone convo&#39;s, texts or social media pages, to help us avoid any missed communication with a color change! Size changes must be approved by us first through Etsy messaging only and the left in the payment note area during checkout through the listing link you are instructed to use or through a special custom listing link created just for your custom sizing! Just message us through the listing link you like best with the size and coloring you need! \\n\\n Our pieces are constructed of solid wood and have experienced the changing seasons, it is likely that you will see shrinkage and expansion . Sometimes you might even see small cracks and splits. Since we strive to have our pieces reflect the feeling of actual antiques, our customers must understand that our furniture could have the same tendency to warp, contract, expand, or split. These similarities between antiques and our furniture may not be desired but should be expected and tolerated. Our furniture is made out of a material that was once alive, and it will always have some seasonal movement. Normal problems such as these should not be repaired as they reflect the nature of such an authentically made reproduction. We build ALL of our furniture complete before painting/staining and taking back apart and labeling pieces for shipment. Nothing is ever cut and pre-drilled without continuing to be built complete, this way there is never a missing piece or misaligned screw/nail holes or wrong sized leg, major wobbles and so forth. \\n\\nWE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR RUSTIC, HAND-CRATED FURNITURE AND RUSTIC HOME DECOR. We sell high quality, hand-made items and try our best to make each piece like the photos of the previous one we&#39;ve created but they are again HAND-MADE items, each one WILL be different in its own way and may not be an exact match to the photo. Each piece will grow to have its own personality, and will be UNIQUE in its own way!

VAN OSDOL :\\n\\nSee more art here: https://fineartamerica.com/artists/scottdvanosdolfinearts\\n\\nScott D. Van Osdol took private art studies for a few years, starting at the very young age of 8, from a Brown County, Indiana artist and won the Eulula Gray scholarship in Arts (the largest scholarship available in Arts) for Vincennes University at the age of 17. He has a great passion for animals and wild connection and love of the great outdoors! His vibrant, colorful art can be found all over the world and especially in many small coastal shops, beachside rentals and high-end coastal homes up and down the eastern coastline of the beautiful shores of the United States. \\n\\nAs a child he was influenced heavily by his family&#39;s outdoor camping and fishing trips as well as vacations to the Florida coastline. Scott has since returned many times with his own family and regularly goes on kayaking, fishing, camping and hiking adventures with his wife and children. Scott runs a full-time rustic furniture business called Unique Primtiques here on Etsy with thousands of sales and 5-star feedback. His tremendous love for nature and the great outdoors keeps him connected to his rustic furniture and home d\u00e9cor creations! \\n\\nHe started working with wood at a young age with his father in a small workshop and grew up in the hills of Brown County, Indiana deep in the woods on 40-acres helping his father cut trees and pull branches to brush piles for burning. He joined his schools woodworking shop classes in the 7th grade at the age of 12 and took woodworking & metal working classes through junior high and focused just on woodworking during high school 7th-12th grade. Scott was refurbishing vintage and mid-century furniture for locals here in southern Indiana and his creations and woodworking became overwhelmingly popular. He decided to leave his job in 2007 after his battle with cancer and start his own full-time woodworking business. He joined Etsy in 2012 after selling locally for several years and his Etsy shop sales and popularity have continued to grow substantially each year. He now makes custom tables for the world famous Sephora Cosmetics, is a licensed vendor making rustic wood displays for Kroger Grocery stores, countless interior designers, doctors offices and restaurants tables along with daily furniture for homes across the USA! \\n\\nScott D Van Osdol is also a Stage-IV colon cancer survivor and has been cancer-free since 2007, a skilled musician that on the piano and guitar since the age of 4, and an author of a book called &quot;Never Ending Dreams&quot;. \\n\\n___________________________________________________________________\\n\\nABOUT UNIQUE PRIMTIQUES CUSTOM WOODWORKING: We sell primitive & rustic furniture from new, reclaimed and often times distressed wood. Expect knots, cracks, dents, dings, marks, discolorations. In most cases we make sure the piece has some of all of the above. All of our pieces are handmade one at a time. We love doing what we do and it shows! \\n\\nVariations in size, color and texture are common occurrences in reclaimed wood and should not be considered as defects. Such features as old saw marks, nail or worm holes, uneven boards, sunspots etc. are what make these tables unique and special. While every precaution has been taken in our finishing process to prevent movement in the wood, fine splits, warping, wobbles may occur as the wood adjusts to new conditions of your home. Please realize that your computer monitor settings may show colors different than ours, some photos are taken on bright sunny days, others on cloudy days, some under inside artificial lighting, some on snow covered days outside. People see colors differently. What may look like aqua blue to myself may look like teal blue to you. We allow our customers to send us a paint brand name/color name and/or color code to use on your order at no extra charge and because of this we do NOT refund on any color issues as we will purchase and use the exact paint or stain color you tell us to use. All color changes must be in the payment note area during checkout, not in back and forth message threads, emails, phone convo&#39;s, texts or social media pages, to help us avoid any missed communication with a color change! Size changes must be approved by us first through Etsy messaging only and the left in the payment note area during checkout through the listing link you are instructed to use or through a special custom listing link created just for your custom sizing! Just message us through the listing link you like best with the size and coloring you need! \\n\\n Our pieces are constructed of solid wood and have experienced the changing seasons, it is likely that you will see shrinkage and expansion . Sometimes you might even see small cracks and splits. Since we strive to have our pieces reflect the feeling of actual antiques, our customers must understand that our furniture could have the same tendency to warp, contract, expand, or split. These similarities between antiques and our furniture may not be desired but should be expected and tolerated. Our furniture is made out of a material that was once alive, and it will always have some seasonal movement. Normal problems such as these should not be repaired as they reflect the nature of such an authentically made reproduction. We build ALL of our furniture complete before painting/staining and taking back apart and labeling pieces for shipment. Nothing is ever cut and pre-drilled without continuing to be built complete, this way there is never a missing piece or misaligned screw/nail holes or wrong sized leg, major wobbles and so forth. \\n\\nWE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN OUR RUSTIC, HAND-CRATED FURNITURE AND RUSTIC HOME DECOR. We sell high quality, hand-made items and try our best to make each piece like the photos of the previous one we&#39;ve created but they are again HAND-MADE items, each one WILL be different in its own way and may not be an exact match to the photo.
