"Hi there! I'm a child care specialist with an educational background in visual art, a passion for creativity and storytelling, and a huge love of working with and spending time with children. Things I like to do with kids include playing outside, playing inside, dress up, arts and crafts of all kinds, swimming, swingsets, sandboxes, train sets, building blanket forts, baking cookies, puzzles, reading, and imagination games (because let's be honest, the floor is legitimately lava.) My core MO with kids is engagement! I like to be active, responsive, attentive and a good listener. My approach is progressive, primarily child-led, and as radical as possible. I like to foster personal responsibility, agency, empathy, thoughtfulness, and a sense of ourselves as both distinct entities and as members of a community. I set boundaries around safety and respecting ourselves and others, and like to collaborate with the children on the rest. I support exploring, learning and having big feelings."
"Hello! I'm a patient, responsible exuberant person with over 10 years of child care experience. I love playing, guiding and protecting children. With my inner child constantly growing I believe kids are the best teachers and probably the greatest company you can have around. My childcare experience covers a lot of imaginative play and educational activities to stimulate physical, social and cognitive development. Along with spending time with children I love to cook, bake, clean and organize the household. I started babysitting at the age of 15 and nannying full time and house managing/house keeping at 22 years old. I have experience caring for newborns-14-year-olds. I have cared for twins, the disabled, children on the spectrum and multiples of four. I'm pet friendly. I'm open to covering additional days, nights, holidays and weekends with proper notice and compensation. My ideal family will provide a steady 40 hour schedule. I look forward to working with you."

"My name is Roma, like the tomato! I am currently a senior in College at the University pursing both Nursing and Sociology degrees. I am planning to graduate in December with my BS and BSN! I hope to become a Pediatrics nurse one day, as I've always loved working with kids! I started babysitting at 13, and have consistently worked with little ones ever since. I was a lifeguard and swim instructor for 4 summers, thus I'm comfortable with supervising kids around water and teaching them to swim. Once getting to college, I earned my EMT license and have worked for 2. 5 years as an EMT and Shift Supervisor at the University campus. I am well trained in first aid, CPR, and have substantial experience in delivering life saving care in the prehospital setting. I then began Nursing School in January of 2022.

"Hi there! I'm a fun, loving, and patient mother of 1! I have over 10 years experience working with children. In addition to nannying and babysitting (newborn-8 years) I've also worked as a camp counselor and cooking class facilitator for children ages 7-11. Recently, I've received the best training there is in becoming a new mom! I understand just how hard it can be to leave your child in the hands of someone else. I want parents to know their child's safety and well-being is my top priority. It's also important we learn and have fun! If you're comfortable with it, I'm happy to take your little one on fun adventures to the park, aquarium, arcade, botanical garden, library, and more! I know firsthand how hard it can be for parents to balance it all, I have no problem helping with household responsibilities like cleaning, laundry, etc. or any errands that may be helpful to you."

"Hello families! My name is Isabella and I am a college educated - wife - mom to my 17-month-old and a step mom to our 8 and 7 years old. After I was looking for my own nanny and interviewing/doing house tours I was frustrated and could not find anyone who would offer us EXCEPTIONAL care. I decided to help other families care for their little ones and I started to get a lot of request from families. My style is hands-on, Montessori, ASL and Spanish speaking zero screen time and being active outside. I promise to make this EASY because I know what it's like struggling to find someone trustworthy for your little ones. I can't wait to chat more :D"
"I have 10+ years of experience with caring for toddlers, infants and teenagers. I have spent a lot of time with kids between working at a daycare, nannying & substitute teaching at an elementary school. I enjoy doing crafts, fun activities and exploring the outdoors with the kids I nanny. I am very energetic and always love trying new activities. Your children will be very well taken care of with me and I also can do any additional tasks if needed around the house. I also love to cook so I would very much enjoy trying new recipes to cook for the kids."
