Profile of Illya Naumov
Since joining Google in early 2022, I've had the pleasure of partnering with cutting-edge financial services and capital market clients across New York City and the globe. My expertise spans the entire GCP product portfolio, and I've had the satisfaction of supporting a diverse range of clients engaged in Infrastructure Modernization, High-Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and ML/AI endeavors.

Prior to my time at Google, I spent five formative years in Storage Infrastructure, Enterprise Backup, and Disaster Recovery. This experience laid a solid foundation for my subsequent role at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I further deepened my cloud knowledge and gained valuable insights into a broader array of customer issues. 

I'm genuinely passionate about empowering businesses to achieve their objectives through the transformative power of cloud technology. I'm always keen to connect with fellow industry professionals, engage in stimulating discussions, and share my expertise on all things GCP.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in scheduling a chat, exploring cloud solutions, or simply learning more about Google and GCP. I'm always happy to connect and share my insights.
