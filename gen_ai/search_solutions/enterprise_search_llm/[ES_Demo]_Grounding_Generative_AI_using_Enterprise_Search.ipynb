        "\n",
        "**LLMs**\n",
        "* Google Cloud's PaLM model and other generative large language models (LLMs) provide a powerful way to generate new data such as text, image and code.\n",
        "* However, LLMs are probabilistic systems which do not possess real 'understanding' - only 'parametric' knowledge encoded in the weighting of relationships between entities in their training data. As such they are susceptible to 'hallucination' whereby they confidently provide answers to user questions which are factually inaccurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retrieval Augmented Generation**\n",
        "* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique which attempts to mitigate the problem of hallucination. In RAG factual information (also called non-parametric data) is retrieved from a data store or search engine and then inserted into the prompt which is sent to the LLM.\n",
        "* The LLM is asked to summarize the information in the prompt rather than generate its own response. This requires careful prompt design, but when successful it can help 'ground' the LLM response in factual, proprietary data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Enterprise Search**\n",
        "* 'Enterprise Search' is a Google Cloud solution which combines LLM with Google search technology to provide users with an out of the box search engine solution\n",
        "* Search engines can be configured to ingest and index structured, unstructured or website data and then retrieve information from this data using natural language queries.\n",
        "* LLMs are used to provide summarization and conversational abilities.\n",
        "* In this notebook, Enterprise Search is used to retrieve data from a search engine, which is then summarized using Google's PaLM LLM.\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Notes\n",
        "* This uses Colab's inbuilt OAuth flow for authentication, so your Google account will need to have access to a GCP project with the ES + LLM APIs enabled in order for this to work.\n",
        "  * The permissions required are \"Discovery Engine Admin\" and \"Vertex AI Administrator\". If running this in Vertex Workbench you will need to grant these permissions to the Service Account that is used by Workbench\n",
        "* No additional fine-tuning, prompt-tuning or retraining has been done on any of the models used here\n",
        "* The examples used here are from private Google projects and search engines - you will need to replace them with your own values."
