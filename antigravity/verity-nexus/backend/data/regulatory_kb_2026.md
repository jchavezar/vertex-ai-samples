## Executive Summary

The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework's Pillar Two rules represent the most significant reform to international taxation in a century. The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules establish a coordinated system ensuring that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) with consolidated revenues exceeding €750 million pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate.

The **2026 Side-by-Side Safe Harbour** amendments introduce critical transitional relief mechanisms and permanent safe harbour provisions designed to reduce compliance burdens while maintaining the integrity of the global minimum tax framework. These amendments reflect lessons learned from the initial implementation period (2024-2025) and address stakeholder feedback regarding administrative complexity.

### Key 2026 Amendments at a Glance

| Amendment | Scope | Impact |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Extended Transitional Safe Harbour | CbCR-based relief | Extended through 2028 for qualifying jurisdictions |
| Permanent Safe Harbour | Simplified calculations | Reduced compliance burden for low-risk jurisdictions |
| SBIE Adjustments | Payroll & asset carve-outs | Gradual phase-down continues per original schedule |
| QDMTT Recognition | Domestic top-up priority | Enhanced guidance on qualifying QDMTT design |

## Substance-based Income Exclusion (SBIE)

### Overview

The Substance-based Income Exclusion (SBIE) represents a critical carve-out mechanism within the GloBE Rules, designed to ensure that the global minimum tax targets excess returns from intangible assets and mobile capital rather than routine returns attributable to genuine economic substance.

### Technical Framework

The SBIE allows MNE groups to exclude from their GloBE Income Base an amount equal to:

**SBIE = (Payroll Carve-out) + (Tangible Asset Carve-out)**

Where:

- **Payroll Carve-out** = Eligible Payroll Costs × Applicable Percentage
- **Tangible Asset Carve-out** = Eligible Tangible Assets × Applicable Percentage

### 2026 Phase-Down Schedule

The SBIE percentages are subject to a 10-year transition period, with the following rates applicable for fiscal years beginning in 2026:

| Component | 2024 Rate | 2025 Rate | 2026 Rate | Final Rate (2033+) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Payroll Carve-out | 10.0% | 9.8% | 9.6% | 5.0% |
| Tangible Asset Carve-out | 8.0% | 7.8% | 7.6% | 5.0% |

### Eligible Payroll Costs

Eligible payroll costs include:
- Employee compensation (wages, salaries, bonuses)
- Payroll taxes and social security contributions
- Pension and retirement benefit costs
- Share-based compensation (subject to limitations)

**Exclusions:** Independent contractor fees, intercompany management charges, and costs related to employees engaged in investment activities.

### Eligible Tangible Assets

Eligible tangible assets are calculated as the average of opening and closing carrying values for:
- Property, plant, and equipment
- Natural resources
- Lessee's right-of-use assets (operating and finance leases)

**Exclusions:** Intangible assets, financial assets, inventory, and assets held for sale.

## Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT)

### Overview

The Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) provides jurisdictions with the first right to collect any top-up tax on low-taxed income arising within their borders. A properly designed QDMTT reduces or eliminates exposure to the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) applied by other jurisdictions.

### Qualification Criteria

For a domestic minimum tax to qualify as a QDMTT and receive priority in the GloBE charging hierarchy, it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **GloBE Income Equivalence:** Compute jurisdictional income using GloBE Income rules or an acceptable alternative
2. **GloBE Tax Equivalence:** Compute covered taxes consistently with GloBE Covered Taxes definitions
3. **Top-up Tax Computation:** Apply the 15% minimum rate using GloBE methodology
4. **No Preferential Benefits:** Cannot provide benefits related to SBIE or other elements that would systematically advantage domestic MNEs
5. **Administrative Compliance:** Must be administered consistently with GloBE principles

### 2026 Implementation Guidance

The OECD's 2026 Administrative Guidance provides enhanced clarity on:

- **QDMTT Safe Harbour:** Qualifying jurisdictions may apply simplified QDMTT calculations
- **Switch-off Provisions:** Circumstances under which QDMTT takes precedence over IIR/UTPR
- **Anti-abuse Rules:** Provisions preventing artificial QDMTT manipulation
- **Currency Translation:** Standardized approach for multi-currency calculations

### QDMTT Accounting Considerations

| Aspect | GloBE Treatment | QDMTT Adjustment |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Deferred Tax Assets | Subject to recapture | May differ based on local rules |
| Tax Loss Carryforwards | GloBE Loss Election available | Must align with jurisdictional approach |
| Minority Interests | Excluded from GloBE calculations | May require separate tracking |

## Transitional Safe Harbour Provisions (2026 Update)

### Side-by-Side Safe Harbour Framework

The 2026 Side-by-Side Safe Harbour amendments establish a parallel compliance pathway allowing MNE groups to rely on Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) data for an extended transitional period while developing full GloBE compliance capabilities.

### Safe Harbour Tests

A jurisdiction qualifies for transitional safe harbour treatment if it satisfies **any one** of the following tests:

#### 1. De Minimis Test
- Revenue < €10 million **AND**
- Profit (Loss) before income tax < €1 million

#### 2. Simplified ETR Test
- Simplified Covered Taxes / Profit before Income Tax ≥ Transition Rate
- **2026 Transition Rate:** 16% (increasing to 17% in 2027, 18% in 2028)

#### 3. Routine Profits Test
- Profit before Income Tax ≤ SBIE Amount for the jurisdiction
- Indicates returns are attributable to substance rather than excess profits

### Data Quality Adjustments

The 2026 amendments introduce mandatory data quality adjustments for CbCR-based calculations:

1. **Related Party Adjustments:** Normalize transfer pricing distortions
2. **Permanent Establishment Allocation:** Proper attribution of profits to PEs
3. **Hybrid Entity Treatment:** Consistent classification across jurisdictions

## Compliance Flags and Manual Review Triggers

### Risk-Based Compliance Framework

Effective Pillar Two compliance requires robust risk identification and escalation protocols. The following categories represent elevated compliance risk requiring enhanced review procedures.

### Mandatory Escalation Triggers

The following circumstances require immediate escalation to senior tax leadership and, where applicable, external advisors:

#### High-Risk Transaction Categories

1. **Cross-Border Service Arrangements**
   - **CRITICAL FLAG:** Any unverified service fees exceeding $100,000 to non-treaty jurisdictions must be flagged for manual forensic review to prevent Top-up Tax evasion.
   - Management fees to low-tax jurisdictions without corresponding substance
   - Technical service fees lacking arm's length documentation

2. **Intellectual Property Transactions**
   - Royalty payments exceeding jurisdictional SBIE carve-outs
   - IP migrations or restructurings affecting GloBE Income calculations
   - Cost-sharing arrangements with disproportionate benefit allocation

3. **Financing Arrangements**
   - Interest payments to jurisdictions with ETR below 15%
   - Hybrid financial instruments with asymmetric tax treatment
   - Captive insurance arrangements lacking economic substance

4. **Restructuring Events**
   - Mergers or acquisitions affecting Constituent Entity status
   - Changes in Ultimate Parent Entity jurisdiction
   - Disposition of low-tax subsidiaries triggering transition rules

### Documentation Requirements

| Risk Level | Documentation Standard | Review Frequency | Approval Authority |
|------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Low | Standard workpapers | Annual | Tax Manager |
| Medium | Enhanced analysis | Quarterly | Tax Director |
| High | Full forensic review | Per transaction | CFO / Tax VP |
| Critical | External validation | Immediate | Audit Committee |

### Penalty Exposure

Non-compliance with GloBE filing and payment obligations may result in:

- Administrative penalties up to 5% of top-up tax liability
- Interest charges on underpaid amounts
- Reputational risk and enhanced audit scrutiny
- Potential criminal liability for willful non-compliance in certain jurisdictions
